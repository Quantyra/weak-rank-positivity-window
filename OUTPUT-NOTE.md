# Output-uniform positivity and explicit SoS size for simple bamboo

Version 4.0.0, 12 September 2026. This note extends the output quantifier
of [SIZE-NOTE.md](SIZE-NOTE.md) from the identity matrix to every Boolean
output at the same parameters, then proves a separately stated indexed,
encoding-specific proof-complexity generator corollary. The underlying
derivation is formal-pvnp commit **4b748b22aa87587f761ddd2d99f342f427a9b0c9**.
Exact authorship, source credits and review status are in [REVIEW.md](REVIEW.md).

The proof is informal mathematics reviewed by AI agents, not human peer
review or Lean verification. Novelty and priority are unknown. This is a
source-relative quantifier extension using established machinery, with
no improved exponent or new restriction distribution. The complete
argument below retains arbitrary-output affine fibers and normalization;
it does not infer the extension merely from the identity case.

## Statements and exact conventions

Let q>=1024 be even, m=q^2, N=8q+4, and

    D=floor(q/(32 log_2 q)), B=2D, a=sqrt(7/8).

Fix **any** A in {0,1}^{m x m}. The matrix constraints defining local
assignments are over F_2. The polynomial functional and certificates are
over R. A is fixed throughout a functional or certificate; no averaging
over outputs is used.

**Row-space theorem.** For the restricted prime simple-bamboo local
functional R_A defined below, R_A(p^2)>=0 for every Boolean-reduced real
polynomial p each of whose monomials uses at most B typed labels. There
is no ordinary-degree bound and no bound on the labels across the whole
sum p. The square is Boolean-reduced before evaluation. In particular
the same conclusion holds for ordinary root degree at most D in the
actual X,Y,U variables.

**Explicit size theorem.** Let F_A be the real clause-falsification
encoding of the unrestricted simple-bamboo CNF BT-bullet-Rank_N^m(A),
with Boolean equations. Every ordinary polynomial identity

    sum_i f_i g_i + sum_j h_j^2 = -1

using its nonzero axioms has

    S=sum_i ||f_i|| ||g_i|| + sum_j ||h_j||
      >= a^(-(B-1)) = (8/7)^((2D-1)/2).                  (1)

Here ||f|| counts nonzero ordinary monomials before Boolean reduction;
roots are explicit before squaring. Repeated occurrences count separately.
There is no certificate-degree limit, coefficient-bit charge, implicit
Gram factor, or arithmetic-circuit representation. Optional literal
twins have their Boolean and v+bar(v)-1 equations. Equation (1) is
exp(Omega(N/log N)), not exp(Omega(N)).

For completeness, F_A consists of the following zero polynomials. For
i,j in [m], k in [N], write x=x_(i,k), y=y_(k,j), b=u_(i,j,k).
Outputs are 1-u_(i,j,N) when A_ij=1 and u_(i,j,N) when A_ij=0. At k=1:

    (1-b)xy, (1-x)b, (1-y)b.

At k>=2, with c=u_(i,j,k-1):

    (1-x)c(1-b), (1-x)(1-c)b,
    (1-y)c(1-b), (1-y)(1-c)b,
    xycb, xy(1-c)(1-b).

Add v^2-v for every variable and the optional twin equations. These
encode b=c XOR (xy) on Boolean points. They do not encode b=c+xy over R.
The input has O(m^2 N)=O(N^5) variables/clauses, with polynomial binary
description length. Nontrivial bounds therefore remain superpolynomial
in this explicit input length.

## Source imports and the output-dependent objects

The primary source is Garlik--Gryaznov--Ren--Tzameret,
[TR26-133](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2026/133/) /
[arXiv:2608.08760v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.08760v1), Section 6.
We use its Definitions 6.1, 6.5--6.8 and Lemmas 6.7, 6.9--6.10 with
their arbitrary-output quantifiers. The exact size convention is its
Definition 4.3. Restriction and consistency are credited imports. The
following derivation checks their application and all output-dependent
quantities in the positivity argument.

Let e=(1,...,1) in F_2^q. A typed set T=(I,J) has X-row indices I and
Y-column indices J; opposite types remain distinct when indices agree.
For |T|<=q-2 let rho_T^A be uniform on vectors x_i,y_j such that

    (e,(x_i)_(i in I)) and (e,(y_j)_(j in J))
        are separately linearly independent,
    e dot x_i=e dot y_j=1,
    x_i dot y_j=A_ij.

The augmented boundary output is 0 at (m+1,m+1) and 1 at the other
boundary entries, since q is even. U is the actual F_2 prefix dot sum;
boundary prefixes use e. The source marginal consistency defines R_A
on monomials of row support <=q-2 and hence on their span. A variable
uses at most two labels. Complementation and Boolean reduction add none.

### Nonemptiness and extension counts for every A

Here is an explicit check of the source's arbitrary-A law, including
the conditional fibers later used. Given r X rows and s Y columns,
put U=span(e,X), V=span(e,Y), so dim U=r+1 and dim V=s+1. The matrix
of their dot pairing in these independent bases is the **prescribed**
matrix

    C = [0, ones_(1 x s); ones_(r x 1), A_(I,J)].

Its rank t depends on A and the selected indices, but not on the chosen
realization of those frames. Adding an X row prescribes its dot products
with the basis of V as (1,A_(i,J)). Since that basis is independent, the
affine solution fiber has exactly 2^(q-s-1) elements. Its intersection
with U is either empty or has 2^(r+1-t) elements. Which case holds is
membership of the prescribed vector in the image of the pairing map
U -> F_2^(s+1), and is determined by C and that vector, not by frame
coordinates. Thus the number of admissible extensions is positive and
realization-independent whenever r+s<=q-3: even the crude subtraction
of all 2^(r+1) elements of U leaves a positive number.

The Y extension is symmetric. Start from e on both sides and adjoin
labels in any order through total support q-2. This proves nonemptiness
for arbitrary A and verifies constant single-step extension counts.
Uniform measure therefore marginalizes to uniform measure under each
deletion; this agrees with the imported consistency lemma. Prefix U
values are deterministic functions of frames, so that consistency
includes their evaluations. No rank hypothesis on A was used.

Condition only on supported separator realizations. Conditional laws
are uniform on exactly the remaining admissible solutions; consistency
gives their uniform marginal laws upon deleting any added blocks. These
statements are not claims of a law on all m rows/columns simultaneously.

## Conditional norm estimates with explicit A dependence

Fix a supported separator with r X rows and s Y columns. With the same
U,V,t as above define

    h=q-(r+1)-(s+1)+t >= q-r-s-2.                       (2)

All appearances of t below retain its actual value until the displayed
worst-case bound. It need not be the identity-output pairing rank.

### Opposite singleton and pure blocks

A new X row has affine fiber X0=x0+V^perp, and a new Y column has
Y0=y0+U^perp. Changing A changes x0,y0 and their prescribed mutual dot
output. The linear directions remain those shown. The bilinear pairing
of V^perp with U^perp has rank h: its left radical is U intersect V^perp,
whose dimension is dim U-t. Consequently the character kernel
(-1)^(x dot y), acting between **uniform probability** L2 spaces on
X0,Y0, has norm 2^(-h/2). Affine translations multiply rows and columns
by signs and a global sign, so do not change that norm.

Deleting X0 intersect U and Y0 intersect V removes either zero or a
fraction 2^(-h) from either side, by the preceding extension calculation.
For the retained uniform spaces the norm is at most

    alpha=2^(-h/2)/(1-2^(-h)).

The indicator of the prescribed new output c=A_ij is
(1+(-1)^c K)/2. Conditional source marginals are uniform on the retained
fibers by consistency. The normalized density is
(1+(-1)^c K)/Z with |Z-1|<=alpha. For centered functions its correlation
is therefore at most alpha/(1-alpha), when alpha<1. The output changes
a sign; it neither fixes the sign of Z-1 nor invalidates the absolute
bound. No division by an unproved A-independent exact value is used.

For added pure blocks of a_X>=1 X rows and b_Y>=1 Y columns use the
product of their row-specific affine cosets before same-side rank
restriction. Sequential span counting gives deletion probabilities

    delta_X <= (2^a_X-1)2^(-h),
    delta_Y <= (2^b_Y-1)2^(-h).                         (3)

Indeed, at the i-th addition the span has dimension dim U+i and its
pairing rank with V is at least t, so at most 2^(dim U+i-t) points lie
in the required affine fiber. A different right-hand side may make
that intersection empty; it cannot exceed the bound. Divide by the
fiber size 2^(q-dim V) and sum over i. This checks the arbitrary-A
deletion estimate without assuming independent retained rows.

Fourier-expand the prescribed a_X-by-b_Y output matrix. A channel
C' of rank k gives a kernel with bilinear rank kh and norm 2^(-hk/2).
Its coefficient is a sign determined by the prescribed output matrix.
At most 2^(k(a_X+b_Y)) matrices have rank k, by factorization through
F_2^k. Put tau=2^(a_X+b_Y-h/2). Summing all nonzero-channel norms gives
at most tau/(1-tau) if tau<1. No identity pattern of outputs is needed
for this triangle inequality.

Condition separately on the X and Y tuple ranks. Restriction and
probability normalization multiply the bound by at most
1/sqrt((1-delta_X)(1-delta_Y)). Write

    gamma = tau / ((1-tau)sqrt((1-delta_X)(1-delta_Y))).

The scaled prescribed-output indicator is 1+E with ||E||<=gamma.
Both source marginals are the uniform retained tuple laws, by the
already-checked consistency. Its normalizing constant obeys
|Z-1|<=gamma. Thus the pure opposite-block centered correlation is at
most gamma/(1-gamma) for gamma<1. This treats rare or differently
correlated prescribed outputs uniformly; it does not replace their
conditional marginals by an arbitrary product comparison.

### Same-side blocks and mixed grouping

For two added same-side blocks of sizes a_X,b_X, start with their
independent individual rank-admissible conditional laws. The combined
source law further excludes rank failure. The preceding span count
gives product-law failure probability at most

    e_ab = 2^a_X(2^b_X-1)2^(-h)/(1-d_b),
    d_b=(2^b_X-1)2^(-h).                               (4)

The denominator charges conditioning the second block on its own rank.
Uniform source marginals imply the actual failure indicator F has
constant row and column means e. The probability-normalized Schur
bound gives ||F||<=e. The centered correlation of density
(1-F)/(1-e) is at most e/(1-e)<=e_ab/(1-e_ab). All prescribed dots here
are to the separator and were already included in its affine cosets.
No same-side A entries enter as extra equations.

For any finite joint law, conditional covariance and conditional-variance
Cauchy--Schwarz give

    rho(P;(Q,R)) <= rho(P;Q) + sup_q rho(P;R | Q=q).

Applying this twice on each side to mixed blocks A0=(A_X,A_Y) and
B0=(B_X,B_Y) bounds rho(A0;B0|s) by four pure-block terms:

    rho(A_X;B_X|s)
    + sup_bx rho(A_X;B_Y|s,bx)
    + sup_ax rho(A_Y;B_X|s,ax)
    + sup_ax,bx rho(A_Y;B_Y|s,ax,bx).                    (5)

Every added conditioning event is supported in an actual source marginal.
It enlarges the separator but does not change total support. Its pairing
rank and right-hand sides may change; (2)--(4) were proved for every
such separator. Empty blocks contribute zero. This avoids a separate
conditioning penalty exponential in the number of internal outputs.

For total separator/block support <=4D, (2)--(3) imply

    tau <= t0=2^(-q/2+4D+1),
    delta_X,delta_Y <= d0=2^(-q+4D+2).

Here t0,d0<=1/16 and d0<=t0. The preceding bounds give
rho_opposite<=4t0 and rho_same<=4d0. For (4), its numerator is at most
d0 and its denominator at least 1-d0, so this same constant is safe.
Equation (5) consequently gives the uniform estimate

    rho(A0;B0|s) <= epsilon=16t0=2^(-q/2+4D+5).         (6)

All estimates act on arbitrary complete-row L2 functions. Prefix
observables are included as functions of their endpoint rows; no
ordinary-degree restriction was used in (6). This finishes the check
of every output-dependent step in the conditional estimates.

## Complete-row assembly for arbitrary outputs

For |T|<=B let L_T=L2(rho_T^A), and J_T be the orthogonal complement
of the span of proper-subset function spaces in L_T. Constants are
J_empty. Consistency makes lifts isometric. Projection to J_T and
induction on |T| express each f in L_T as a sum of h_S in J_S for S
subset T. All spaces are finite-dimensional; no efficient decomposition
or product-measure orthogonality is asserted.

Apply this to each monomial of p and combine components with the same
support. Pair functions on T,V using rho_(T union V)^A. Their union has
size <=2B=4D<=q-2. Local almost-sure identities remain true in that law
by consistency, so replacing within each monomial pair proves

    R_A(p^2)=sum_(T,V) E_(rho_(T union V)^A)[h_T h_V].

Nested distinct supports have zero pairing by the J definition.
Incomparable supports have conditional mean zero on their intersection;
apply (6) to the disjoint differences, then average with Cauchy--Schwarz.
The absolute off-diagonal pairing is at most epsilon ||h_T||||h_V||;
diagonal terms are ||h_T||^2. This proof does not require a joint law
for all labels in p, or low ordinary degree of the h_T.

With L_ctx=sum_(j<=B) binom(2m,j), diagonal dominance gives

    R_A(p^2) >= [1-(L_ctx-1)epsilon] sum_T ||h_T||^2.

Our unchanged parameters give 4D<=q/8, L_ctx<=2(2q^2)^(2D), and

    log_2 L_ctx <= 1+6D log_2 q <= 1+3q/16,
    L_ctx epsilon <= 2^(-3q/16+6) < 1/2.

Hence R_A(p^2)>=0, proving the row-space theorem. The only label-count
parameter is m=q^2; nothing in this step adopts arbitrary m. The
ordinary-degree consequence follows because a degree-D monomial uses
at most 2D labels even when a U variable has a long prefix.

## A-preserving restriction and size transfer

Apply the source Definition 6.8 substitution at input N=8q+4. For each
X_i independently select a uniform type s_i in [4] and bit alpha_i;
for each Y_j independently select a uniform type r_j and bit beta_j.
All choices are independent. The exact templates, with the earlier
visual transcription corrections retained, are

    Dmat=[1 * 1 0 0 * * *; 0 1 * 1 * * * 0;
          * * 0 * 1 0 1 *; * 0 * * * 1 0 1],
    Emat=[1 0 0 1 * * * *; 0 * 1 * 1 * 0 *;
          * 1 * 0 * 0 * 1; * * * * 0 1 1 0].

The X endpoint columns (1,2,N-1,N) become (alpha_i,1,alpha_i,1);
Y endpoints become (1,beta_j,1,beta_j). Split the interior into eight
blocks of width q. A star in a row's template becomes the corresponding
residual coordinate; a constant stays constant.

For each row pair and block b, let gamma_b equal A_ij for star/star,
1 for star/1 or 1/star, and 0 otherwise. Define the parity offset
p_b=alpha_i+beta_j+sum_(c<b) gamma_c over F_2. Its U images are the
residual interior prefix in star/star, the appropriate boundary prefix
in star/1 or 1/star, complemented when p_b=1. A 1/1 block uses constant
p_b+(ell mod 2), and a block with a zero uses p_b. Endpoint U images
are alpha_i, alpha_i+beta_j, A_ij+beta_j, A_ij. Thus A changes only
specified parity offsets and output literals. Twins map to complements.

For each template pair, the star/star count is odd and the star/1 and
1/star counts are even. Constant 1/1 blocks contribute even q, hence
zero parity. The total block parity is therefore A_ij for either value
of that entry. Initial and final endpoint parities cancel alpha_i,beta_j.
This checks the A dependence of the output; it does not assume A_ij is
a diagonal entry. The residual is exactly the restricted prime system
at width q, with the **same** m and A.

Each image is a literal or constant. In R-polynomial notation this is
a homomorphism using 1-v for complements, Boolean-valued on Boolean
assignments, and it cannot add a typed row. By the arbitrary-A source
Lemma 6.9, an original literal monomial with r interior typed rows
survives with probability at most a^r. Endpoint factors become constants
and cannot increase this probability. Powers and twins can be treated
as literal products for this event. The A-dependent prefix offsets do
not require a fresh distributional independence assertion: they are
part of the imported arbitrary-output restriction lemma.

Count the original monomial occurrences in all g_i and h_j, including
Boolean/twin multipliers. Their number T is at most S, since each
nonzero axiom has at least one monomial. If S<a^(-(B-1)), the union bound
gives probability less than one that any such monomial with >=B-1
interior rows survives. Fix a substitution outside that event. Every
surviving root/multiplier image uses at most B-2 rows per monomial.
Complement expansion and Boolean reduction add no rows; their sizes
need not be small. Roots were counted before squaring, so their images
are covered by the row-space theorem even as arbitrary long sums.

For each original clause, the image is zero in the residual local law
on its at most two endpoint labels. Within a block the prefix transition
is a residual gate or a constant transition; at a block boundary the
previous residual output supplies gamma_b and the next residual base
starts with the corresponding p_b. Boundary strips have output 1 and
interior strips have output A_ij. The endpoints and overall parity were
checked above. Thus source Lemma 6.10's semantic check holds for every
A entry, without importing its SA conversion as an arbitrary-sign
ideal simulation.

The union of that clause's labels with a surviving multiplier monomial
uses <=B labels. Its product therefore has expectation zero in a genuine
source law, and consistency transports this to R_A after expansion.
Boolean and twin images vanish identically in the Boolean quotient.
All root squares use <=2B-4<=q-2 labels per monomial. Applying R_A to
the substituted identity is consequently legitimate and gives

    0 + sum_j R_A(rho(h_j)^2) = -1,

contradicting normalization and square positivity. This proves (1) for
every A. No assumption that A has high rank was used in this argument.

There are 6m independent restriction bits, and an explicit substitution
has O(m^2 N) entries. Conditional spaces and decompositions can be huge;
their computation is not claimed efficient. No coefficient precision,
affine-expansion bound or hidden proof-size conversion is used.

## Satisfiable outputs, nonrange outputs and exact scope

The unrestricted simple encoding is satisfiable exactly when
rank_(F_2)(A)<=N: a factorization through F_2^N gives X,Y and true
prefixes, and any satisfying assignment gives that factorization. For
such an output no displayed real SoS refutation exists, since evaluation
at a satisfying Boolean assignment would make a sum of real squares
equal -1. Its size lower bound is therefore vacuous, as it should be.
The positive local functional theorem remains a statement about the
specified rho_T^A, regardless of whether a global assignment exists.

For rank(A)>N, the output is outside the width-N multiplication range;
the encoding is contradictory and (1) is a refutation-size lower bound.
This covers all such outputs at the fixed parameters. The separate
corollary below specifies the map, encoding, stretch and complexity
requirements needed for its proof-complexity interpretation.

## Separately proved indexed generator corollary

For the same even q>=1024, m=q^2 and N=8q+4, define

    G_q : {0,1}^{s_q} -> {0,1}^{t_q},
    G_q(X,Y)=XY over F_2,
    s_q=2mN=16q^3+8q^2, t_q=m^2=q^4.

The seed is the entries of an m-by-N matrix X followed by an N-by-m
matrix Y, each in row-major order. The output is listed row-major.
The prefix U variables are uniquely determined existential witnesses
of the specified inversion encoding, not additional seed or output
bits. Neither the all-ones boundary nor odd-row constraints of the
restricted proof are imposed on this original map.

**Corollary.** This uniformly constructible indexed map has output
length t_q=Theta(s_q^(4/3)) for seed length s_q, and every nonrange output
has inversion
refutation size at least

    K_q=(8/7)^((2D-1)/2)
       =exp(Omega(s_q^(1/3)/log s_q))
       =exp(Omega(t_q^(1/4)/log t_q))

in the explicit real SoS measure (1), using exactly the simple-bamboo
clause-falsification encoding displayed above. This is the meaning of
encoding-specific proof-complexity generator in this corollary.

**Proof.** Computing m^2 binary dot products takes O(m^2 N)=O(q^5)
Boolean operations. Indexed loops construct the map and its inversion
CNF in polynomial time; indices use O(log q) bits. Since
s_q=Theta(q^3) and t_q=q^4, the output-length relation follows, and
t_q/s_q=q^2/(16q+8)>1 throughout the displayed range. The output-to-seed
ratio is Theta(q)=Theta(s_q^(1/3)). This is an
indexed family at these seed lengths, not an unstated all-length padding
or stretch-amplification construction.

For an output A, its exact inversion relation has seed X,Y and prefixes
u_(i,j,1)=x_(i,1)y_(1,j) and
u_(i,j,k)=u_(i,j,k-1) XOR (x_(i,k) AND y_(k,j)), ending at A_ij.
Use the displayed clauses, without additional product variables. It has
2mN+m^2N variables and (6N-2)m^2 clauses before optional twins and Boolean
equations: one output, three base and six clauses per subsequent step
for each matrix entry. Width is at most four; binary description length
is O(q^5 log q). Constant clause arity gives constant many ordinary
monomials per clause axiom. Boolean/twin equations preserve these
polynomial bounds.

As shown above, range(G_q) consists exactly of matrices with F_2 rank
at most N. Thus every nonrange A gives an unsatisfiable inversion CNF
and satisfies (1). In-range outputs have no sound SoS refutation, so
the all-output formulation treats them vacuously. Also
|range(G_q)|<=2^s_q<2^t_q, and I_m is an explicit nonrange output.
Finally q/log q has the displayed expressions in s_q and t_q up to
constant factors. The bound is superpolynomial in the output length
and in the explicit inversion-CNF bit length. This proves the corollary.

## Scope and source-relative contribution

The extension is uniformity in A at m=q^2, not an arbitrary-m theorem,
a better exponent or a new restriction. The conditional proof uses
established Fourier, rank-counting, covariance and Hilbert-space tools.
The generator corollary adds exact representation and parameter
accounting to the all-output theorem; it is not an independent lower-bound
mechanism. [SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md) gives the closest comparisons.

Range membership and preimages remain computable in polynomial time by
binary rank testing and factorization. The corollary asserts no
computational pseudorandomness or inversion hardness. It provides no
arbitrary-m extension, all-length padding, iteration, amplification,
nearly quadratic or exponential stretch, or function-generator result.
It is not a lower bound for circuit-compressed certificates, implicit
Gram factors, another gate encoding, general proof systems, or SAT
runtime. No circuit lower bound or P-versus-NP conclusion follows.
Novelty and priority remain unknown.
